# Alternative Installation Options

## Using Wget

If you prefer `wget` over `curl`:

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardaum/restart-on-windows/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Updating

To update your installation, simply run the installation command again:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardaum/restart-on-windows/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer will update your existing installation with the latest code from the main branch.
